:Course-Code: IS 210

Overview
========

This exercise will have you interacting with several files. You'll create a
series of functions that will correlate two data sources then write your output
to a report.

Instructions
============

The following tasks will either have you interacting with existing files in
the assignment repository or creating new ones on the fly. Don't forget to add
your interpreter directive, utf-8 encoding, and a short docstring with any new
files that you create!

.. important::

    In these exercises, you may, on occasion, come across a task that requres
    you to research or use a function or method not directly covered by the
    course text. Since Python is such a large language it would be impossible
    for the author to have included descriptions of each and every available
    function which would largely duplicate the offical Python documentation.

    A *vital* skill to successful programming is being comfortable searching
    for and using official language documentation sources like the
    `Python String Documentation`_ page. Throughout our coursework we will be
    practicing both the use of the language in practice and the search skills
    necessary to become functional programmers.

Warmup Tasks
============

Task 01
-------

The goal of this particular exercise is to open and read a CSV file found on
the local filesystem. You'll be creating a function that takes a filename
as a string then returning a summarized version of the data.

The particular data we'll be analyzing is one-month of NYC Restaurant
Inspection data. You'll be returning a boro-average score.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a file named ``boroughs.py``

#.  Recreate the following grading scale as a dictionary with float values:

    .. table:: Grades

        ====== =====
        Letter Value
        ====== =====
        A      100%
        B      90%
        C      80%
        D      70%
        F      60%
        ====== =====

#.  Give a quick look at ``inspection_results.csv`` to get a sense of the data
    with which we'll be working.

#.  Create a function named ``get_score_summary()``

    #.  ``get_score_summary()`` takes exactly 1 argument, a string which
        represents the filename whose data will be read and interpreted

    #.  Use the file manipulation tools to open the file and read each line
        of the data. The data is stored as a CSV and is split by commas. The
        first row are headers and each subsequent row lists a restaurateur and
        their violations. This means that each vendor has their data duplicated
        several times.

    #.  Loop through the file data by reading each line and de-duplicating our
        vendors by making a simpler dictionary keyed by just the CAMIS id code
        and the GRADE and BORO as a stored value. You can skip ungraded and
        pending (P) restaurateurs since they don't have enough meaningful data
        to analyze.

        .. tip::

            Don't forget to close your file descriptor after you're done!

    #.  Next, loop through our deduplicated list and create a dictionary that
        counts the number of restaurateus per boro and sums their scores after
        converting them to floats using the grading scale.

    #.  Finally, perform one last data conversion and return a dictionary,
        keyed by boro, whose value is a tuple with the number of restaurateurs
        per boro (who have scores), and the average score (as a float) for that
        boro.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> get_score_summary('inspection_results.csv')
    >>> {'BRONX': (156, 0.9762820512820514), 'BROOKLYN': 
    (417, 0.9745803357314141), 'STATEN ISLAND': (46, 0.9804347826086955), 
    'MANHATTAN': (748, 0.9771390374331531), 'QUEENS': 
    (414, 0.9719806763285017)}

Task 02
-------

Next, we'll be performing a similar transformation with a JSON file. JSON is
one of the most popular data formats available because of its compactness and
portability. The Python ``json`` module will be helping us convert the JSON
file.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Start by taking a peek inside ``green_markets.json`` to just get a sense
    of what the data looks like. This particular file is very dense as it
    comes from a professional source and describes all the Green Markets
    currently held in the city. We'll be reducing this data to a count of
    markets per borough.

#.  Open ``boroughs.py``, we'll be working in this file again.

#.  Import the ``json`` module.

#.  Create a function named ``get_market_density()``

    #.  Takes one argument, a filename

    #.  Open a file descriptor for our JSON file and pass the opened file
        object to json's ``load()`` function to return the data as a dictionary

    #.  Loop through the data found in the ``'data'`` and count the number of
        markets per borough, saving the result as a dictionary.

    #.  Return a dictionary of the number of green markets per borough.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> get_market_density('green_markets.json')
    {'STATEN ISLAND': 2, 'BROOKLYN': 48, 'BRONX': 32,
    'MANHATTAN': 39, 'QUEENS': 16}

.. note::

    I forced the borough names to uppercase here to make it easier to correlate
    borough data between the two data sources.
    
.. warning::

    There's a bad record in one of the boro names (it has an extra space -- how would you normalize the name?)

Task 03
-------

Finally, we'll combine these two pieces of data on their borough keys and write
the results to a file. This particular relation is fairly noneventful but it
demonstrates the power of I/O methods in Python quite well.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Open ``boroughs.py``

#.  Create a new function, ``correlate_data()``

    #.  Takes three arguments:

        #.  First argument is the name of a file with restaurant scores data

        #.  Next argument is the name of a JSON file with green_market data

        #.  The final argument is the name of a file that will contain the
            output of this function.

    #.  Use the previous two functions to get aggregate market and restaurant
        score data per-borough.

    #.  Combine the data into a single dictionary, keyed by borough, whose
        whose values are tuples containing the borough food score and the
        percentage density of green markets to restaurateurs as a float.

        The result of this should be similar to:

        .. code:: python

            {'BRONX': (0.9762820512820514, 0.1987179487179487)}

    #.  Finally, use the json module's ``dump()`` method to write the combined
        data dictionary to a file (the one occupying the third argument in
        the function call).

Executing Tests
===============

Code must be functional and pass tests before it will be eligible for credit.

Linting
-------

Lint tests check your code for syntactic or stylistic errors To execute lint
tests against a specific file, simply open a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ pylint filename.py

Where ``filename.py`` is the name of the file you wish to lint test.

Unit Tests
----------

Unit tests check that your code performs the tested objectives. Unit tests
may be executed individually by opening a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and typing:

.. code:: console

    $ nosetests tests/name_of_test.py

Where ``name_of_test.py`` is the name of the testfile found in the ``tests``
directory of your source code.

Running All Tests
-----------------

All tests may be run simultaneously by executing the ``runtests.sh`` script
from the root of your assignment repository. To execute all tests, open a
terminal in the same directory as your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ ./runtests.sh

Submission
==========

Code should be submitted to `GitHub`_ by means of opening a pull request.

As-of Lesson 02, each student will have a branch named after his or her
`GitHub`_ username. Pull requests should be made against the branch that
matches your `GitHub`_ username. Pull requests made against other branches will
be closed.  This work flow mimics the steps you took to open a pull request
against the ``pull`` branch in Week Two.

For a refresher on how to open a pull request, please see homework instructions
in Lesson 01. It is recommended that you run PyLint locally after each file
is edited in order to reduce the number of errors found in testing.

In order to receive full credit you must complete the assignment as-instructed
and without any violations (reported in the build status). There will be
automated tests for this assignment to provide early feedback on program code.

When you have completed this assignment, please post the link to your
pull request in the body of the assignment on Blackboard in order to receive
credit.

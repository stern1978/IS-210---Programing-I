Overview
========

The Python dict class is Python's core mapping-type. With it, data may be
stuctured and related with meaningful keys which opens a huge realm of program
capabilities.

Instructions
============

The following tasks will either have you interacting with existing files in
the assignment repository or creating new ones on the fly. Don't forget to add
your interpreter directive, utf-8 encoding, and a short docstring with any new
files that you create!

.. important::

    In these exercises, you may, on occasion, come across a task that requres
    you to research or use a function or method not directly covered by the
    course text. Since Python is such a large language it would be impossible
    for the author to have included descriptions of each and every available
    function which would largely duplicate the offical Python documentation.

    A *vital* skill to successful programming is being comfortable searching
    for and using official language documentation sources like the
    `Python String Documentation`_ page. Throughout our coursework we will be
    practicing both the use of the language in practice and the search skills
    necessary to become functional programmers.

Warmup Tasks
============

Task 01
-------

Dictionaries can often be thought of as tabular data which is why they're so
commonly used to represent database data. For this task, we'll be creating
a dictionary from a table of data.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a file, ``task_01.py``.

#   In ``task_01.py``, create a constant called ``GRADE_DATA`` that stores the
    following table, *Grades*,  as a **nested** dictionary.

    #.  The first level key of the dictionary is ``student`` which represents
        the student's name.

    #.  Second level keys of this dictionary should map to the subjects.

    #.  Do not use functions that convert data of other types to instantiate
        the dictionary. You should use some form of the ``{}`` syntax to
        construct the dictionary.

    #.  Your dictionary construction should be clean and well-indented to make
        it easy to read.

Data
^^^^
    
.. table:: Grades

    ====================== ================ =====
    student                subject          grade
    ====================== ================ =====
    Luke Skywalker         math             B
    Luke Skywalker         etiquette        B+
    Luke Skywalker         grammar          B
    Luke Skywalker         gym              A
    Han Solo               math             A-
    Han Solo               etiquette        C-
    Han Solo               grammar          B
    Han Solo               gym              B
    C-3PO                  math             C
    C-3PO                  etiquette        A+
    C-3PO                  grammar          A

Task 02
-------

There are a number of ways to access data from dictionaries. Here we'll
practice a few of the most common ones.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Start off by opening ``data.py`` and just taking a look at the structure of
    the ``BANDS`` dictionary.

#.  Create a file named ``task_02.py``.

#.  In ``task_02.py``, import the ``data`` module.

#.  In one line, create a new constant named ``NIGEL`` and use dictionary keys
    to assign its value value from the ``'Nigel Tufnel'`` entry of the
    ``data.BANDS`` dictionary.

#.  Create a new constant named ``BANDS_NAMES`` and use a built-in dictionary
    function to fill it with a list of band-names from ``data.BANDS``.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_02
    >>> task_02.NIGEL
    ['guitar', 'vocals', 'bass', 'violin', 'harmonica', 'clarinet',
     'keyboards', 'piano']
    >>> task_02.BAND_NAMES
    ['The Rolling Stones', 'Van Halen', 'Spinal Tap', 'Queen', 'The Beatles',
     'The Who', 'Fleetwood Mac']

Task 03
-------

There are a number of ways to add or remove keys to Python dictionaries. Here,
we'll cover the most common types.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a new file named, ``task_03.py``

#.  Import the ``data`` module.

#.  With ``task_03.py``, copy ``data.BANDS`` into a new constant named
    ``CORRECTED``.

    .. tip::

        Keep in mind that the assignment operator (``=``), doesn't create a new
        dictionary, it just creates a new reference to it. There is a built-in
        dictionary function that creates a new copy of a dictionary.

#.  Using the assignment syntax (``[]``) add a new entry to ``CORRECTED``
    with a key value of ``Dylan`` and the following value:

    .. code:: python

        {'Bob Dylan': ['vocals', 'guitar', 'harmonica']}

#.  Remove the ``'David Lee Roth'`` entry from the ``'Van Halen'`` entry of
    ``CORRECTED`` with the ``del`` statement.

#.  Using the assignment syntax (``[]``), add a new entry to
    ``CORRECTED['Van Halen']`` with key ``'Sammy Hagar'`` and value
    ``['vocals']``.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> CORRECTED['Van Halen'].keys()
    ['Eddie Van Halen', 'Sammy Hagar', 'Michael Anthony', 'Alex Van Halen']

Task 04
-------

The ``.update()`` method is a powerful tool for merging dictionary data as
you'll see below.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a file named ``task_04.py``.

#.  With ``task_04.py``, create a new top-level band entry in ``data.BANDS``
    with the key, ``'Buckingham Nicks``. The key:values of ``Buckingham Nicks``
    are:

    .. code:: python

        'Lindsey Buckingham': ['guitar', 'vocals'],
        'Stevie Nicks': ['vocals', 'tambourine']

#.  Use a built-in dictionary function to merge 
    ``data.BANDS['Buckingham Nicks']`` into 
    ``data.BANDS['Fleewood Mac']`` so that there are now five keys in
    ``data.BANDS['Fleetwood Mac']``.

Task 05
-------

Changing dictionary values is nearly identical to assigning them.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a file named ``task_05.py``.

#.  With ``task_05.py``, import the ``data`` module.

#.  Change the value of ``data.SUPERHEROES['Logan']['alias']`` to
    ``'Wolverine'`` without altering ``data.py`` and without creating a new
    dictionary or variable.

Task 06
-------

The ``.get()`` function has surprising utility when traversing data that
could be incomplete.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Start by taking a peek inside ``data.SUPERHEROES`` to get a sense of its
    structure.

#.  Open ``task_06.py``

#.  Complete line 10 of ``task_06.py`` so that the ``'pet'`` key of the
    ``HERO_DATA`` dictionary is added to the new ``SUPER_SIDEKICKS``
    dictionary.

#.  If no pet data exists, the returned value should be ``None``

#.  Use a built-in dictionary function to achieve this objective.

#.  Restrict your edits to just line 10.

Task 07
-------

It is often very useful to iterate through a dictionary object separating the
iteration into key and value pairs. In this task you will need to use your new
knowledge of dictionary iteration using the ``iteritems()`` method.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  Create a file named ``task_07.py``

#.  Declare a variable named ``DATA`` as a dictionary object. Assign it a set
    of key/value pairs. This is example data for you to work with but you may
    create any dictionary of data provided it is at least 10 items long and
    both keys and values are integers.

#.  Create a function named ``iter_dict_funky_sum()`` that takes one
    dictionary argument.

    #.  Declare a running total integer variable.

    #.  Extract the key/value pairs from ``DATA`` simultaneously in a loop. Do
        this with just one ``for`` loop and no additional forms of looping.

    #.  Assign and append the product of the value minus the key to the running
        total variable.

    #.  Return the funky total.

Example Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: python

    DATA = {
        2: 7493945,
        76: 4654320,

        153: 12074784,
        8: 4337229
    }

Examples

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_07
    >>> task_07.iter_dict_funky_sum(task_07.DATA)

Executing Tests
===============

Code must be functional and pass tests before it will be eligible for credit.

Linting
-------

Lint tests check your code for syntactic or stylistic errors To execute lint
tests against a specific file, simply open a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ pylint filename.py

Where ``filename.py`` is the name of the file you wish to lint test.

Unit Tests
----------

Unit tests check that your code performs the tested objectives. Unit tests
may be executed individually by opening a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and typing:

.. code:: console

    $ nosetests tests/name_of_test.py

Where ``name_of_test.py`` is the name of the testfile found in the ``tests``
directory of your source code.

Running All Tests
-----------------

All tests may be run simultaneously by executing the ``runtests.sh`` script
from the root of your assignment repository. To execute all tests, open a
terminal in the same directory as your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ ./runtests.sh

Submission
==========

Code should be submitted via Blackboard.
